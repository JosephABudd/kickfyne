🗽 GETTING STARTED WITH kickzig.
Build and run the application framework.
In this case the framework is built with messages.

＄ mkdir myapp
＄ cd myapp
＄ kickzig framework add-messages
＄ zig fetch --save https://github.com/david-vanderson/dvui/archive/27b59c5f25350ad4481110eecd0920b828e61a30.tar.gz
＄ zig build -freference-trace=255
＄ ./zig-out/bin/myapp

🌐 THE FRAMEWORK:
The framework is contained in these folders.
1. ./ which contains build.zig, build.zig.zon.
2. ./src/ which contains main.zig.
3. ./src/frontend/ which contains the front-end code.
4. ./src/deps/ which contains the dependencies.
5. ./src/backend/messenger/ which contains the optional back-end messenger code.

Framework Options.
1. Build the framework without messages.
   This is the default framework setting.
   ＄ kickzig framework
2. Build the framework with messages.
   ＄ kickzig framework add-messages


📺 MANAGING SCREENS WITH kickzig.
Screen names must be in TitleCase.
Panel names must be in TitleCase.
Tab names must be in TitleCase.

＄ cd myapp
＄ kickzig screen help
＄ kickzig screen list
＄ kickzig screen add-panel «screen-name» «panel-name, ...»
＄ kickzig screen add-tab «screen-name» «[*]tab-name, ...»
＄ kickzig screen add-modal «screen-name» «panel-name, ...»
＄ kickzig screen remove «screen-name»

Tab names:
* A tab-name prefixed with '*':
  Will get its content from the screen of the same name.
  That screen must already exist.
* A tab-name not prefixed with '*':
  Will get its content from a panel of the same name.
  That panel will be created in the same screen as the tab.

After a screen is added:
1. A link to it's screen.zig file is displayed.
2. A search for KICKZIG TODO in the screen package files will reveal instructions for proper developement and management of the screen operation.

＄ cd myapp
＄ kickzig message help
