TabItem names:
* A tab-item-name prefixed with '*':

  That screen must already exist.
* A tab-item-name not prefixed with '*':
  Will get its content from a panel of the same name.
  That panel will be created in the same tabbar screen package.

AccordionItem names:
* An accordion-item-name prefixed with '*':
  Will get its content from the screen package of the same name.
  That screen must already exist.
* An accordion-item-name not prefixed with '*':
  Will get its content from a panel of the same name.

After a screen is added:
1. A link to it's screen.zig file is displayed.
2. A search for KICKFYNE TODO in the screen package files will reveal instructions for proper developement and management of the screen operation.
